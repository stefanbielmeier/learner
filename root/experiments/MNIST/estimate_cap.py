    Takes: 2D numpy array representing an unlabeled dataset with rows as data points and columns as features.

    Returns: the approximated capacity in bits required from a Hopfield network to memorize the whole set with close to 0% retrieval error

    Intuition: if the dataset contains less overlapping / complicated memories (orthogonal memories), n should be smaller because the hopfield net doesn't have to remember as many memories 
    but can extract features instead

    More thresholds => more complexity in the set => higher n required
